This repository is a shared space for project conducted in collaboration with HAIDS Lab


## Expected Update Content
1. Analysis of the paper on [D-attn /  Interpretable Convolutional Neural Networks with Dual Local and Global Attention for Review Rating Prediction](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3109859.3109890).
2. Unified preprocessing method for applying to three different models(DeepCoNN, Transnet, D-attn)
3. Modularization of each model

## Updated Record
# 2024.12.26
- Uploaded the **'Dataset/train, valid, test.csv'** file. <br/>
(The files are not datasets actually derived from the **Upload_Unified_Preprocessing_Subscription Boxes Dataset.ipynb** file but are datasets intended for learning purposes to understand the data structure.)

# 2024.12.24
- Uploaded the **'Upload_Unified_Preprocessing_Subscription Boxes Dataset.ipynb'** file. <br/>
(The embedding process is not included yet. This process is expected to be updated.)

# 2024.12.23
- Uploaded the **'D-attn/Upload_D_attn_model.ipynb'** file. (Reference: [CNN-with-Dual-Local-and-Global-Attention](https://github.com/seongjunyun/CNN-with-Dual-Local-and-Global-Attention/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file)) <br/>
- **Detailed explanations** regarding hyperparameter and the structure of the modal have been added. 

# 2024.12.21
 - Uploaded the **'DeepCoNN/Upload_DeepCoNN.ipynb'** and **'Transnet/Upload_Transnet'**, **'Transnet/Upload_preprocess'** file.

# 2024.12.20
 - Created a repositories.
